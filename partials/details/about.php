    <section>
        <p>Designer, developer, maker of things. I build for the web with care and
        curiosity, and I&rsquo;ve been doing it long enough to know that the best
        code is the code you don&rsquo;t have to explain twice.</p>

        <p>Most of my work lives at the intersection of design and engineering &mdash;
        the place where pixels meet logic and neither gets to win every argument.
        I care about accessibility, performance, and making things that feel good
        to use. Not in a manifesto way. In a &ldquo;this button should be where you
        expect it&rdquo; way.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m drawn to craft. The kind where you can see the thought behind
        the choices. Whether that&rsquo;s a well-structured stylesheet, a crochet
        pattern that actually lines up, or a yoyo trick that took three weeks to
        land &mdash; I like things that reward patience.</p>

        <h2>Skills &amp; Interests</h2>
        <p>The professional ones and the ones that make me interesting at parties
        (different lists, some overlap).</p>

        <h3>Technical</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Front-end development &mdash; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the whole stack</li>
            <li>PHP &mdash; yes, on purpose, and I&rsquo;d do it again</li>
            <li>CSS architecture &mdash; the kind where you plan before you nest</li>
            <li>Responsive design &mdash; not just &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t break&rdquo; but actually good</li>
            <li>Accessibility &mdash; WCAG, ARIA, semantic HTML, screen reader testing</li>
            <li>Performance optimisation &mdash; every kilobyte is a choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Human</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Crochet <em>&mdash; I&rsquo;ve made more granny squares than I can count.
            Literally. I lost count around two hundred.</em></li>
            <li>Rollerblading <em>&mdash; poorly, but with the conviction of someone
            who doesn&rsquo;t know they&rsquo;re bad at it</em></li>
            <li>Yoyoing <em>&mdash; walk the dog, sleep, rock the baby. That&rsquo;s
            the full repertoire.</em></li>
            <li>Reading <em>&mdash; mostly non-fiction, mostly half-finished</em></li>
            <li>Making playlists <em>&mdash; for moods that don&rsquo;t exist yet</em></li>
        </ul>
