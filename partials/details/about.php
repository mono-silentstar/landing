    <section>
        <p>I&rsquo;m a final-year MSci Computer Science student at Cardiff University,
        graduating in 2026. My path into CS started from A-Levels in Music, Physics,
        and Maths &mdash; a combination that still shows up in how I work. Music taught
        me to think about composition and structure. Physics taught me to model systems.
        Maths gave me the tools. CS gave me somewhere to put all of it.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m a generalist by instinct. I&rsquo;ve worked across web development
        (React, Laravel, HTMX), 3D and XR (Unity, Blender, OpenGL), and backend systems
        (Java, Python, PHP, MySQL). I don&rsquo;t pick tools because they&rsquo;re
        popular &mdash; I pick them because they fit the problem.</p>

        <p>What I keep coming back to, across every project and every hobby, is systems
        design. Not just &ldquo;how does this work&rdquo; but &ldquo;how does this fit
        together, how does it scale, how does it stay coherent as it grows.&rdquo;
        Whether I&rsquo;m writing a backend, designing a game world, or planning a
        series of craft projects, the approach is the same: understand the constraints,
        find the structure, build something that makes sense.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m based in Cardiff and open to relocating within the UK or internationally.</p>
