            <h3>MSci Computer Science</h3>
            <p class="detail-cv-meta">Cardiff University &bull; 2022 &ndash; 2026</p>
            <p>Relevant coursework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Programming Paradigms</strong> &mdash; Object-oriented, functional,
                and procedural approaches. Not just learning each one, but understanding
                when each is the right choice.</li>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> &mdash; Design patterns,
                architecture, building systems that are maintainable rather than just functional.</li>
                <li><strong>Graphics Programming</strong> &mdash; Low-level rendering with
                OpenGL (JOGL). Building a 3D pipeline from scratch teaches you things no
                framework ever will.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyber Security and Risk Management</strong> &mdash; Thinking about
                systems from the perspective of what can go wrong.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Computing</strong> &mdash; How people interact with and
                through technology. The human side of systems design.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>A-Levels</h3>
            <p class="detail-cv-meta">Chase Grammar School, Cannock &bull; 2020 &ndash; 2022</p>
            <p>Music (A), Physics (B), Mathematics (B)</p>
            <p>The Music A-Level isn&rsquo;t decorative. Composition is about structure, timing,
            and knowing when something resolves. That thinking shows up in how I design
            systems &mdash; there&rsquo;s a sense of &ldquo;does this feel complete&rdquo;
            that goes beyond whether the tests pass.</p>

        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, C#, HTML/CSS</li>
            <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> React, Laravel, HTMX, Spark. I&rsquo;ve built
            with enough framework combinations to know that no single stack is the answer &mdash;
            the right tools depend on what you&rsquo;re building and why.</li>
            <li><strong>3D &amp; XR:</strong> Unity, Blender, OpenGL (JOGL), Three.js. From
            modelling assets to building immersive VR experiences to rendering pipelines
            written from scratch.</li>
            <li><strong>Database &amp; Backend:</strong> MySQL, API design, schema architecture.
            Building the parts of the system nobody sees but everyone relies on.</li>
            <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git. Non-negotiable.</li>

        <h2>What I&rsquo;m Learning</h2>
        <p>I don&rsquo;t stop at what coursework requires. The portfolio you&rsquo;re looking
        at was built because I wanted to understand how to present work properly. The D&amp;D
        encounter planner I&rsquo;m building exists because the available tools didn&rsquo;t
        work the way I think. I learn by building things I actually want to use.</p>
