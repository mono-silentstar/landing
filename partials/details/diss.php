        <h2>On the Persistence of Bookmarks in Digital Spaces</h2>
        <p class="detail-cv-meta"><em>Submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for
        the degree of Master of Science, 2017</em></p>

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>This thesis investigates how users organise, abandon, and rediscover
        saved content across web platforms. Through mixed-methods research combining
        quantitative browser data analysis with qualitative semi-structured interviews
        (n=24), it maps the lifecycle of the digital bookmark from hopeful curation
        to quiet neglect.</p>

        <p>The study finds that bookmarking behaviour is driven more by aspiration
        than by utility &mdash; users save content they intend to return to but rarely do,
        creating personal archives that function as portraits of unrealised intent
        rather than useful reference libraries.</p>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>73% of bookmarks are never revisited</strong> after the first
            week of saving. The median bookmark lifespan (from creation to last access)
            is 3.2 days.</li>

            <li><strong>Folder structures mirror aspirational self-image</strong> more
            than actual behaviour. Users create categories like &ldquo;To Read&rdquo;,
            &ldquo;Research&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Inspiration&rdquo; that reflect who they
            want to be, not how they actually use the web.</li>

            <li><strong>The &ldquo;Read Later&rdquo; folder is, functionally, a graveyard.</strong>
            Items saved to explicit &ldquo;read later&rdquo; collections had the lowest
            revisitation rate of any category (8.3%).</li>

            <li><strong>Users report guilt</strong> about unread bookmarks at rates
            comparable to unread books on a physical shelf. 67% of participants used
            the word &ldquo;should&rdquo; when discussing their saved items.</li>

            <li><strong>Rediscovery is serendipitous, not systematic.</strong> When
            users do return to old bookmarks, it&rsquo;s usually by accident while
            searching for something else. No participant reported a regular
            &ldquo;bookmark review&rdquo; habit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Participants exported their browser bookmark data (anonymised) and
        participated in 45-minute interviews about their saving and retrieval
        habits. Data was analysed using thematic analysis alongside descriptive
        statistics on bookmark creation, access frequency, and folder organisation.</p>

        <p>The study was conducted under ethical approval and all personally
        identifiable URLs were stripped during the anonymisation process. Which
        is a shame, because some of those bookmarks were genuinely fascinating.</p>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>The findings contribute to our understanding of personal information
        management and have implications for the design of browser interfaces,
        read-later applications, and content recommendation systems. If
        &ldquo;Read Later&rdquo; means &ldquo;Never&rdquo;, perhaps we should
        design for that honestly.</p>
