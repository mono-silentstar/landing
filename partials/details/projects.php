            <h3>This Portfolio</h3>
            <p class="detail-cv-meta">HTMX, PHP, Three.js, CSS &bull; Live &mdash; you&rsquo;re looking at it.</p>
            <p>This site is the project. Built from scratch as an interactive book, not a template.
            The design choice was deliberate &mdash; a portfolio should demonstrate the thing it
            claims. Every page, every interaction, every layout decision was made by hand.</p>

            <h3>D&amp;D Encounter Planner</h3>
            <p class="detail-cv-meta">In development</p>
            <p>A session management tool built for the way I actually run games. Most encounter
            planners assume you have everything written down in advance. I don&rsquo;t &mdash;
            I work from a mental model and improvise at the table. This tool is designed for
            that workflow: flexible enough to support improvisation, structured enough to keep
            things consistent.</p>

            <h3>Immersive XR Experience for Equestrian Promotion</h3>
            <p class="detail-cv-meta">Unity, Blender, C# &bull; Third-year Dissertation Project</p>
            <p>Built an immersive XR environment for a horse club client exploring virtual reality
            as a promotional tool. Created 3D models and environments in Blender, integrated into
            Unity for interactive VR. This project involved regular client meetings, iterative
            design, requirements gathering, and a formal dissertation and presentation delivered
            to external stakeholders and academic supervisors.</p>

            <h3>Tool Lending Platform</h3>
            <p class="detail-cv-meta">Java, MySQL, HTML/CSS &bull; Backend Developer &amp; Database Lead</p>
            <p>An Airbnb-style tool lending platform. I designed and implemented the MySQL database
            schema for user accounts, tool listings, and transactions, built API endpoints connecting
            frontend to data, and coordinated across team members working on different system
            components.</p>
            <p>What I took from this: the hardest part of group projects isn&rsquo;t the code &mdash;
            it&rsquo;s making sure four people&rsquo;s mental models of the system actually match.</p>

            <h3>OpenGL Graphics Coursework</h3>
            <p class="detail-cv-meta">Java (JOGL), OpenGL</p>
            <p>A custom 3D rendering pipeline built from scratch. Manually created geometric objects,
            applied transformations, and handled rendering without the safety net of a game engine.
            This is the project that taught me what frameworks are actually doing under the hood &mdash;
            and made me appreciate both the abstraction and the cost of it.</p>
