        <p>Final-year MSci Computer Science, Cardiff University.</p>
        <p>I like building things that hold together &mdash; clean architecture,
        intentional design, systems that work because they were thought through,
        not hacked into shape.</p>
        <p>I care about the structure of what I make as much as whether it runs.</p>

        <p>When I&rsquo;m not writing code, I&rsquo;m designing D&amp;D worlds,
        planning crochet projects, or reworking a cooking system.</p>
        <p>Everything I touch tends to become a framework eventually.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m looking for work where I get to build things properly.</p>
