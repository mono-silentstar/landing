        <p>An AR horse you can walk up to in your living room. Built for a Welsh
        horse club client who wanted to explore XR as outreach. I learned 3D
        modelling from scratch, visited their stables for reference photos,
        and built the whole pipeline from Blender to Unity to Meta Quest.</p>
